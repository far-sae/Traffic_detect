# **Traffic Detection System**

This project is a Traffic Detection system designed to identify and analyze traffic through video feeds. The system is built using Python and HTML and leverages machine learning models to detect various objects related to traffic.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files:

* app.py: The main application file that runs the traffic detection system.
* index.html: A simple HTML file that serves as the front-end, displaying the video feed for traffic detection.
* traffic_detection.py: The Python script containing the logic for detecting traffic using machine learning models.
* coco.names: A text file listing the names of objects that the machine learning model can detect.
* traffic_detection.cpython-38.pyc and traffic_detection.cpython-312.pyc: Compiled Python files used by the system.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher
* Flask (for the web server)
* OpenCV (for video processing)
* TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model used)

## Installation

Clone this repository:

   ` git clone  https://github.com/far-sae/Traffic_detect.gi`

`cd Traffic-detect`

Install the required Python packages:

`    pip install -r requirements.txt`

Ensure requirements.txt contains all the necessary dependencies.

Run the application:

`    python app.py`

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the traffic detection in action.

## Usage

The web interface (index.html) will display the video feed, where detected objects are highlighted.

## Customization

* Modify traffic_detection.py to change the detection logic or to fine-tune the model.
* Edit coco.names to include or exclude specific objects from detection.

## Deployment

To deploy this project on a server, ensure that you have the necessary server setup and that all dependencies are correctly installed. You can use services like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud for deployment.
